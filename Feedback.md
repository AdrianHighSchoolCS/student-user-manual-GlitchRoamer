## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: (face to face or in writing or other) Both </p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other) Both</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way: "You should actually..."</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other) Do it lightly </p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: (timely, includes specific examples, is constructive...etc) Helpful and informational</p>
